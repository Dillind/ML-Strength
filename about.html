              In the vibrant heart of Brisbane, ML Strength emerged in 2012 with
              a simple yet profound vision: to empower our community through
              fitness. From humble beginnings, we grew, fueled by passion and a
              commitment to well-being. Starting as a modest venture, our gym
              blossomed into a hub of strength, positivity, and transformation.
              Today, we cherish our roots, appreciating every milestone
              achieved, and every life positively impacted on this remarkable
              journey. <br />

              Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing.
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              I competed as an amateur in my early years and now like to share
              my knowledge and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to
              jump into the ring as your sparring partner. For over three
              decades, I have been involved in the boxing scene. I competed as
              an amateur in my early years and now share my knowledge and
              expertise as a coach, by running my boxing classes with passion
              and enthusiasm. The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun,
              exciting and highly energised. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              So, whether it's your first class or you're an intermediate boxer,
              I encourage you to come along to one of our classes, as I can
              guarantee it is one of the best cardiovascular workouts available!
